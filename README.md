## üìã Usage

### Basic Commands:

- `/start` - Show welcome message and instructions
- `From To Date Time` - Start ticket search (e.g., `–¢–æ–ª–æ—á–∏–Ω  –ú–∏–Ω—Å–∫-–ü–∞—Å—Å–∞–∂–∏—Ä—Å–∫–∏–π 2024-12-25 08:00`)

### How It Works:

1. Send your search request in the specified format
2. Bot will validate your input and confirm the search
3. It saves your request in db
4. Then, Bot continuously checks ticket availability every n seconds
5. If someone with ticket cancels his ticket (which happens quite often),
   you will receive an instant notification that a ticket has become available
6. Use "Cancel" to stop searching or "Another ticket" to add more searches
